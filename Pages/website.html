            <h2>Website Creation Project was rather easy but also difficult for our team leader who is used to working with .NextJs and TailwindCss. Team leader sliced the project into 4 parts and gave everyone a task to complete, everyone even had their specific deadline for completion. Everyone worked hard, some did design parts with css, some did structuring and linking, and team leader polished everything and fixed mistakes.</h2>
